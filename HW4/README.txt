Homework 4 
Kenneth Arnold 

To compile and run code: 

sh homework4.sh

This compiles and runs number 1 & 2 successively

There are print statements to confirm each part
_______________________________________________________
For number one I calculated by hand the solution to P 
The PDF goes into the details of the derivation
This code calculates writes all the data to a file 
so that it can be plotted in python 
_______________________________________________________
For number two the code calculates the mass by 
the Monte Carlo integration method. This code calculates 
the mass for values of N 10-10^7 and saves the data to 
a file to be plotted in python.
_______________________________________________________
The shell script then plots the histogram in number one 
and saves the fig as P_inv_Hist.png. It aslo plots the 
Mass from number two and saves the figure as Mass.png
