To run code: 

sh homework5.sh

This runs the code for number one and two 
__________________________________________

First it compiles each code for a specific step size and plots each one individually
The plots are all saved in the directory "plots"

It then calculates the residuals in log space and plots those as well.
__________________________________________

It then compiles the code for number 2 for individual steps and plots
The code plots the 2D orbits and the energy of the orbit as a function of time

All plots are saved in the directory "plots" 

NOTE: The shell script cleans the directory of all data files and plots each time the code is run
