To run this script: 

sh homework2.sh

This will run code for each question and sub question. 
Answers to questions are written in the .pdf file.
Each question is seperated by a --------------- to denote where the code for each question begins.

The shell script starts by defining an array for N to run.
The shell script then compiles the code for each question in the homework.
Each execution command has its name specified by which part it is running.

The shell script then plots the execution times using python with and without the optimization flag and saves the figs as .png.
